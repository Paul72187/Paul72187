## Introduction

Formerly in research, communications and healthcare, I have always sought to develop and learn new skills. My command of research and communications was used to drive new business ideas and increase revenue streams for established companies in the UK and across Europe. My work became increasingly data-driven, using VBA and SPSS, which encouraged me to take the leap into coding and software development, enticed by the opportunity of using these skills to assist in developing new business ideas and/or introducing change and innovation within existing businesses.

I have had a significant career break to care for my father, which has given me time for reflection and a renewed perspective on life. Whilst I enjoyed my previous career, the emphasis was very much on reporting and telling a compelling story of existing client challenges and the broader political, economic and social context in which these challenges sit. Having been introduced to coding through quantitative analysis, I have become increasingly excited by the prospect of creating something innovative from scratch which will potentially give clients a differential advantage over their competitors. The idea of being given a more experimental licence to proactively instigate change and progression within an organisation through the use of computer programming is particularly appealing.
